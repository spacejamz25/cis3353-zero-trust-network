Physical / virtual layout (conceptual):

- Hypervisor host running:
  - pfSense firewall VM (ztna-fw)
  - Windows Server (AD + CA)
  - One or more Windows 10/11 clients
  - Optional Linux server in DMZ for web/demo

- Virtual switches / port groups:
  - Mapped to VLAN 10/20/30/40/99
  - pfSense has one interface per VLAN

This text describes the lab layout we would build if we had full resources.
