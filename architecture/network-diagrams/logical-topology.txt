Logical network topology for the Zero Trust lab (simulated).

VLANs and subnets:
- VLAN 10 – MGMT        – 10.10.10.0/24
- VLAN 20 – CORPORATE   – 10.20.10.0/24
- VLAN 30 – DMZ         – 10.30.10.0/24
- VLAN 40 – GUEST/BYOD  – 10.40.10.0/24
- VLAN 99 – QUARANTINE  – 10.99.10.0/24

pfSense acts as the policy enforcement point (PEP) between all VLANs.  
Default stance: **deny everything**, then allow only:

- CORP → DMZ (TCP 443)
- MGMT → any (administration)
- GUEST → Internet-only (TCP 80/443, no internal RFC1918)
- QUARANTINE → no access to internal RFC1918

Diagrams based on this description can be created in draw.io or PowerPoint.
