# Technical Architecture – CIS 3353 Zero Trust Lab (Simulated)

This document summarizes how the pieces fit together:

- pfSense for segmentation and firewalling.
- Windows AD + PKI for identity and certificate-based trust.
- Wazuh-style SIEM for centralized logging and alerting.
- Scripts for compliance scoring, anomaly detection, quarantine, and alerts.

It corresponds to the Zero Trust design presented in class.
