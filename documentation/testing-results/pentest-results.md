# Penetration Test Scenarios (Simulated)

These tests are written as if they were executed against the Zero Trust lab.

## PT-01 – Guest-to-Corporate RDP Attempt

- Source: 10.40.10.25 (Guest/BYOD VLAN)
- Destination: 10.20.10.10 (Corporate server)
- Expected: Blocked by firewall; high-severity SIEM alert.

Example pfSense log (simulated):
<134>Nov 30 21:14:55 filterlog: 3,,,1000000103,em1,match,block,in,4,0x0,,64,12345,0,DF,6,tcp,60,10.40.10.25,10.20.10.10,53412,3389,RA guest_to_corp_rdp

## PT-02 – After-Hours Access to Internal Web App

- Source: Managed workstation (10.20.10.15)
- Destination: DMZ web app (10.30.10.10:443)
- Time: 22:30 (AfterHours)
- Expected: Blocked by time-based rule; logged.

## PT-03 – Access to Known Malicious Domain

- Source: 10.20.10.16 (Corporate client)
- Destination: malicious.example.com
- Expected: Blocked by proxy; SIEM alert referencing threat intel IOC.

These tests show how the Zero Trust policies would behave under attack.
