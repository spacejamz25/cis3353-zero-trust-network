## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project implements a fully functional **Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA)** as part of the **CIS 3353** curriculum.  
The environment integrates:

- **Network segmentation** using pfSense  
- **Certificate-based identity & authentication** via PKI  
- **Device trust evaluation** using compliance scoring  
- **Advanced access controls** (time-based, role-based, trust-based)  
- **SIEM monitoring** using Wazuh + Sysmon  
- **Threat intelligence & anomaly detection**  
- **Automated response** including quarantine  
- **Penetration testing and end-to-end validation**

This repository contains all scripts, documentation, diagrams, test results, and automation required to demonstrate a complete Zero Trust implementation.
